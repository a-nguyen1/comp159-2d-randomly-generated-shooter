## Words of Wisdom
David: “*Sketch a visual design of the game prior to even writing a line of code. The visual provides a reference to build code towards the visual and make changes when necessary.*”

Zihao: “*Figure out the logic before writing a line of code specially if you are working with a member on your team, otherwise would cause problem if you have different idea or ways to do it.*”

Austin: “*Communication is important to make sure that everyone on the team is able to contribute effectively.*”

Leah: “*At one point some of the tasks had some layover so it was hard to not redo some of the code others had written.*”

Matthew: "*Getting used to GitHub is like learning to ride a bike – challenging at first, but with practice, it becomes second nature.*"
